    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><h3>A Deep Learning model for speech and facial expression based emotion
        detection</h3></li>
    <p>In this project we tried to identify four basic emotions: anger, sadness, neutral, happiness
        from speech. Here we used audio file of short Manipuri speech taken from movies as training
        and testing dataset. This work uses CNN to identify different emotions using MFCC (Mel
        Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) as features extraction technique from speech.</p>
        <li><h3>Solar power bank using IC 7805</h3></li>
        <p>The objective of this research is to design a Solar Powered Portable power bank for mobile
            phone using sunlight as its ultimate power, which can be used effectively during disaster
            events. It has in-built solar panel which converts the solar energy to electrical energy.</p>
